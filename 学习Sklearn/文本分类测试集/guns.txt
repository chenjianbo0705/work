A gun is a machine used to shoot bullets. Guns are also called "firearms".
 They can be of many different sizes: small enough to hold in one hand, or large enough to 
fire shells to sink a warship . Guns that are small enough to be carried and used b
y one person all have the same basic parts: a trigge, a barrel£¨£©, and a handle. The trigger is pulled by a finger to fire the bullet. The barrel guides the bullet. The handle is held by the human who will fire the gun.
In military terms, the word "firearm" is usually used for the type of weapons that soldier
s carry (pistols and rifles, while the word "gun" is used for larger guns that fire at higher speed. The weapons on warships and tanks are called "guns" or "turrets" (if placed on a rotating base), not "firearms".
Guns are very effective weapons. Guns guide bullets at a very high speed which is mu
ch more deadly than a traditional arrow. Bullets are contained within rounds, also kno
wn as cartridges  A cartridge consists of a bullet, a casing, Propellant£© and a primer. Cartridges have different ways of being loaded into different kinds of weapons. Cartridges can be loaded directly into a firearm or into a clip, a magazine or other bullet container which is loaded into the firearm. Some firearms have their rounds loaded into the stock (or butt) of the weapon. A clip is loaded with rounds and the clip is loaded into a weapon. The magazine  is a container for the rounds which has a spring
 that moves the bullets into place for firing. Firearms known as revolvers have a cylinde
r with holes that the bullets are loaded into. Modern guns are usually loaded with a ma
gazine and are called automatic loading.
